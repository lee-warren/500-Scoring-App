# 500-Scoring-App

An ios App I created back in highschool that helps create track of scores when playing the card game 500.
I haven't made any changes to it since then, I don't even have a Macbook to test it on anymore.

I remember really liking this though. My friends and I would often play 500 during our free periods, so we would use this alot to keep track of all the points
